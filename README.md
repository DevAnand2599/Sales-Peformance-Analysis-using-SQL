# 🚴‍♂️ Sales-Peformance-Analysis-using-SQL
A comprehensive SQL based Analysis of a company's data to uncover sales trends, product popularity and store performance metrics.

## 📋 Overview

This project dives deep into the transactional data of a bike-sharing company to extract meaningful business insights. By analyzing sales patterns across multiple stores, I identified which products were flying off the shelves and which stores were crushing their sales targets versus those that needed a boost.
The analysis focuses on two main areas: understanding what customers love to buy at each store location, and comparing how different stores perform quarter after quarter. Through this work, I uncovered significant performance gaps (up to 25%!) between stores, providing actionable insights for management to make data-driven decisions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Database: SQL (Relational Database Management System)
- Query Language: SQL
- Analysis Tools: MySQL

## 📊 SQL Functions & Techniques Used

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) -> For organizing complex queries into readable, modular components
- Aggregate Functions -> SUM(), COUNT(), AVG() for calculating sales totals and quantities
- Window Functions -> ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK() for store and product rankings
- GROUP BY Clauses -> For store-wise and product-wise aggregations
- Date Functions -> For quarterly time-period segmentation and analysis
- Subqueries -> For nested analytical operations
- JOIN Operations -> To connect multiple tables and extract comprehensive insights

## 🎯 Key Tasks Performed

### 1️⃣ Product Popularity Analysis
- Identified the most popular product in each store based on total quantity sold
- Ranked products within each store to understand customer preferences
- Created store-specific product performance reports

### 2️⃣ Quarterly Sales Performance Comparison
- Calculated total sales revenue for each store on a quarterly basis
- Performed time-series analysis to track performance trends
- Generated comparative rankings of all stores per quarter

### 3️⃣ Store Performance Benchmarking
- Ranked stores based on quarterly sales performance
- Identified top-performing stores and those requiring strategic intervention
- Highlighted performance gaps of up to 25% between high and low performers

### 4️⃣ Data-Driven Insights Generation
- Produced actionable reports for management decision-making
- Created visualizable data outputs for business stakeholders
- Enabled identification of stores needing operational improvements

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

Through this capstone project, I strengthened my skills in:
- Advanced SQL Query Writing -> Mastered complex queries using CTEs and window functions for real-world business problems
- Data Aggregation & Analysis -> Learned to efficiently aggregate large transactional datasets to extract meaningful patterns
- Business Intelligence -> Developed the ability to translate raw data into actionable business insights
- Performance Optimization -> Understood how to write optimized queries for faster execution on large datasets
- Analytical Thinking -> Enhanced problem-solving skills by breaking down complex business questions into structured SQL queries
- Comparative Analysis -> Gained experience in time-series and cross-sectional performance comparisons

## 🎓 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of SQL in transforming raw transactional data into strategic business intelligence. By identifying product popularity patterns and store performance gaps, the analysis provided management with clear insights to optimize inventory, improve underperforming locations, and replicate success strategies from top performers.

The 25% performance gap discovered between stores opened up opportunities for targeted interventions, whether through better inventory management, staff training, or marketing initiatives. This capstone solidified my understanding that data analysis isn't just about running queries—it's about telling a story that drives business decisions.
